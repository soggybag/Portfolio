## Wordpress work
I taught a class in web design using Wordpress. The class covered creating a blog theme for Wordpress from scratch and 
creating a custom web site using Wordpress as a CMS. 

### Sample Theme

A theme created (2012) as an in class example. View my blog using this theme here:

The source for the theme is here:

### Non-profit sites

The class would create sites for non-profit organizations when project were available. I would art direct and cosult for 
the entire class, with each student making their own version of the site. 

#### Nob Hill Gazette

This is a demo for a redesign of the Nob HillGazzette web site. I did extensive revisions of the student work for the 
client on this project.
